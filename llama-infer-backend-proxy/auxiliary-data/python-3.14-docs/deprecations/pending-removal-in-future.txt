Pending removal in future versions
**********************************

The following APIs will be removed in the future, although there is
currently no date scheduled for their removal.

* "argparse":

  * Nesting argument groups and nesting mutually exclusive groups are
    deprecated.

  * Passing the undocumented keyword argument *prefix_chars* to
    "add_argument_group()" is now deprecated.

  * The "argparse.FileType" type converter is deprecated.

* "builtins":

  * Generators: "throw(type, exc, tb)" and "athrow(type, exc, tb)"
    signature is deprecated: use "throw(exc)" and "athrow(exc)"
    instead, the single argument signature.

  * Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by
    keywords, for example "0in x", "1or x", "0if 1else 2".  It allows
    confusing and ambiguous expressions like "[0x1for x in y]" (which
    can be interpreted as "[0x1 for x in y]" or "[0x1f or x in y]").
    A syntax warning is raised if the numeric literal is immediately
    followed by one of keywords "and", "else", "for", "if", "in", "is"
    and "or".  In a future release it will be changed to a syntax
    error. (gh-87999)

  * Support for "__index__()" and "__int__()" method returning non-int
    type: these methods will be required to return an instance of a
    strict subclass of "int".

  * Support for "__float__()" method returning a strict subclass of
    "float": these methods will be required to return an instance of
    "float".

  * Support for "__complex__()" method returning a strict subclass of
    "complex": these methods will be required to return an instance of
    "complex".

  * Passing a complex number as the *real* or *imag* argument in the
    "complex()" constructor is now deprecated; it should only be
    passed as a single positional argument. (Contributed by Serhiy
    Storchaka in gh-109218.)

* "calendar": "calendar.January" and "calendar.February" constants are
  deprecated and replaced by "calendar.JANUARY" and
  "calendar.FEBRUARY". (Contributed by Prince Roshan in gh-103636.)

* "codecs": use "open()" instead of "codecs.open()". (gh-133038)

* "codeobject.co_lnotab": use the "codeobject.co_lines()" method
  instead.

* "datetime":

  * "utcnow()": use "datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.UTC)".

  * "utcfromtimestamp()": use
    "datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=datetime.UTC)".

* "gettext": Plural value must be an integer.

* "importlib":

  * "cache_from_source()" *debug_override* parameter is deprecated:
    use the *optimization* parameter instead.

* "importlib.metadata":

  * "EntryPoints" tuple interface.

  * Implicit "None" on return values.

* "logging": the "warn()" method has been deprecated since Python 3.3,
  use "warning()" instead.

* "mailbox": Use of StringIO input and text mode is deprecated, use
  BytesIO and binary mode instead.

* "os": Calling "os.register_at_fork()" in multi-threaded process.

* "pydoc.ErrorDuringImport": A tuple value for *exc_info* parameter is
  deprecated, use an exception instance.

* "re": More strict rules are now applied for numerical group
  references and group names in regular expressions.  Only sequence of
  ASCII digits is now accepted as a numerical reference.  The group
  name in bytes patterns and replacement strings can now only contain
  ASCII letters and digits and underscore. (Contributed by Serhiy
  Storchaka in gh-91760.)

* "sre_compile", "sre_constants" and "sre_parse" modules.

* "shutil": "rmtree()"'s *onerror* parameter is deprecated in Python
  3.12; use the *onexc* parameter instead.

* "ssl" options and protocols:

  * "ssl.SSLContext" without protocol argument is deprecated.

  * "ssl.SSLContext": "set_npn_protocols()" and
    "selected_npn_protocol()" are deprecated: use ALPN instead.

  * "ssl.OP_NO_SSL*" options

  * "ssl.OP_NO_TLS*" options

  * "ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3"

  * "ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS"

  * "ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1"

  * "ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1"

  * "ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2"

  * "ssl.TLSVersion.SSLv3"

  * "ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1"

  * "ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_1"

* "threading" methods:

  * "threading.Condition.notifyAll()": use "notify_all()".

  * "threading.Event.isSet()": use "is_set()".

  * "threading.Thread.isDaemon()", "threading.Thread.setDaemon()": use
    "threading.Thread.daemon" attribute.

  * "threading.Thread.getName()", "threading.Thread.setName()": use
    "threading.Thread.name" attribute.

  * "threading.currentThread()": use "threading.current_thread()".

  * "threading.activeCount()": use "threading.active_count()".

* "typing.Text" (gh-92332).

* The internal class "typing._UnionGenericAlias" is no longer used to
  implement "typing.Union". To preserve compatibility with users using
  this private class, a compatibility shim will be provided until at
  least Python 3.17. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-105499.)

* "unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase": it is deprecated to return a
  value that is not "None" from a test case.

* "urllib.parse" deprecated functions: "urlparse()" instead

  * "splitattr()"

  * "splithost()"

  * "splitnport()"

  * "splitpasswd()"

  * "splitport()"

  * "splitquery()"

  * "splittag()"

  * "splittype()"

  * "splituser()"

  * "splitvalue()"

  * "to_bytes()"

* "wsgiref": "SimpleHandler.stdout.write()" should not do partial
  writes.

* "xml.etree.ElementTree": Testing the truth value of an "Element" is
  deprecated. In a future release it will always return "True". Prefer
  explicit "len(elem)" or "elem is not None" tests instead.

* "sys._clear_type_cache()" is deprecated: use
  "sys._clear_internal_caches()" instead.
